It extends the once official `django-contrib-comments <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/django-contrib-comments>`_ with the following features:

#. Thread support, so comments can be nested.
#. Customizable maximum thread level, either for all models or on a per app.model basis.
#. Optional notifications on follow-up comments via email.
#. Mute links to allow cancellation of follow-up notifications.
#. Comment confirmation via email when users are not authenticated.
#. Comments hit the database only after they have been confirmed.
#. Registered users can like/dislike comments and can suggest comments removal.
#. Template tags to list/render the last N comments posted to any given list of app.model pairs.
#. Emails sent through threads (can be disable to allow other solutions, like a Celery app).
#. Fully functional JavaScript plugin using ReactJS, Bootstrap 5.3 and Remarkable.
