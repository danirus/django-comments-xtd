--------------------

   * Fixes `issue #333 <https://github.com/danirus/django-comments-xtd/issues/333>`_ produced when using django-comments-xtd with Django 3.2 with MySQL/MariaDB. The issue raises when calling 'update()' on queries with 'sorted_by', as it is the case of the default 'objects' manager of XtdComment.

    * Enhance the queryset in notify_comment_followers using distinct when possible. And fallback to the previous queryset when distinct is not supported, as is the case for sqlite. See `issue #326 <https://github.com/danirus/django-comments-xtd/issues/326>`_. Thanks to @enzedonline.

[2.9.2] - 2021-06-19
--------------------

    * Fixes issue with nested_count XtdComment's attribute being wrongly computed when comment threads are more than 2 level deep and have more than 1 thread. See `PR-312 <https://github.com/danirus/django-comments-xtd/pull/312>`_.
    * Resolves limitation in API views. Avoid using explicit XtdComment model and rather use the `get_model` function to allow using customized comment models with API. See `PR-313 <https://github.com/danirus/django-comments-xtd/pull/313>`_. Thanks to @r4fek.
    * Enhance comment form initialization, so that original fields are not override but rather only some of its attributes. See `PR-315 <https://github.com/danirus/django-comments-xtd/pull/315>`_. Thanks to @dest81.

    * Fixes issue when the 'sent' view does not receive a 'c' query string parameter. See `PR-305 <https://github.com/danirus/django-comments-xtd/pull/305>`_. Thanks to @dest81.

[2.9.0] - 2021-03-20
--------------------

    * Drops support for Django 2.0 and 2.1.
    * Requires django-contrib-comments >= 2.1, and djangorestframework >= 3.12.

    * Fixes issue with `render_xtdcomment_tree` templatetag, thanks to @dest81. See `PR-295 <https://github.com/danirus/django-comments-xtd/pull/295>`_.
    * Fixes issue `#291 <https://github.com/danirus/django-comments-xtd/issues/291>`_, about the frontend plugin not being aware of the setting COMMENTS_XTD_DEFAULT_FOLLOWUP. It also fixes the content of the `login_url` props attribute. Its value is now the content of `settings.LOGIN_URL`.
    * Fixes issue `#284 <https://github.com/danirus/django-comments-xtd/issues/284>`_, about sending a comment twice by clicking the comment send button twice. It happened when not using the JavaScript plugin.

[2.8.5] - 2021-03-02
--------------------

    * Fixes issue `#292 <https://github.com/danirus/django-comments-xtd/issues/292>`_ with the workflow upload-pypi.yml, that caused the package bundle to be built without JavaScript files.

[2.8.4] - 2021-02-28
--------------------

    * Adds Italian translation (thanks to @dlrsp-dev).
    * Fixes issue `#279 <https://github.com/danirus/django-comments-xtd/issues/279>`_, about a syntax mistake in the get_flags function, in the models.py module. Thanks to @manisar2.
    * Fixes issue `#271 <https://github.com/danirus/django-comments-xtd/issues/271>`_, about an issue with django-comments-xtd data migration 0008. The fix consists of making the migration non-effective. It also requires that the django project developer runs the management command :ref:`initialize_nested_count` manually, so that the field `nested_count` of `XtdComment` gets populated with the correct value. The command is idempotent. Thanks to @jxcl.

[2.8.3] - 2021-02-07
--------------------

    * Adds new setting COMMENTS_XTD_DEFAULT_FOLLOWUP, which is used to initialise the follow-up form field. By default its value is False. Thanks to @drholera. Closes ticket `#206 <https://github.com/danirus/django-comments-xtd/issues/206>`_.
    * Fixes issue `#274 <https://github.com/danirus/django-comments-xtd/issues/274>`_, about wrong validation of fields name and email in the WriteCommentSerializer. Thanks to @dest81.

[2.8.2] - 2021-01-24
--------------------

    * Fixes issue `#248 <https://github.com/danirus/django-comments-xtd/issues/248>`_, about the API returning comments' submit_date in UTC when the setting USE_TZ is enabled and a different TIME_ZONE is given. Thanks to @Loneattic.
    * Fixes issue `#250 <https://github.com/danirus/django-comments-xtd/issues/250>`_, which reports that using the web API to post a comment with a reply_to field that would break the max_thread_level should not produce an exception but rather a controlled response with an appropriate HTTP code.  Thanks to @impythonista.
    * Fixes issue `#255 <https://github.com/danirus/django-comments-xtd/issues/255>`_, about the web API not returning the comment ID when creating a new comment. Thanks to @mhoonjeon.
    * Fixes issue `#256 <https://github.com/danirus/django-comments-xtd/issues/256>`_, about an issue in the JavaScript plugin that displays the "reply" link even when the max_thread_level has been reached. Thanks to @odescopi.

[2.8.1] - 2020-10-16
--------------------

    * Fixes issue `#80 <https://github.com/danirus/django-comments-xtd/issues/80>`_, that requests to change the response when clicking more than once on a comment confirmation link. Up until now clicking more than once on a comment confirmation link produced a HTTP 404 response. Since version 2.8.1 the response is the same as for the first click: the user is redirected to the comment's view in the page. Thanks to @ppershing.
    * Fixes issue `#152 <https://github.com/danirus/django-comments-xtd/issues/152>`_, about loading the `staticfiles` templatetag instead of `static`. Since Django v3.0 the staticfiles app requires using the latter. Thanks to @JonLevy and @mennucc.
    * Fixes issue `#221 <https://github.com/danirus/django-comments-xtd/issues/221>`_, about the get_version function. Now it returns the full
      version number ``<major>.<minor>.<patch>``. Thanks to @mckinly.
    * Fixes issue `#229  <https://github.com/danirus/django-comments-xtd/issues/229>`_, about failing to process empty honeypot field when posting comments using the REST API. Thanks to @TommasoAmici.

[2.8.0] - 2020-09-26
--------------------

    * Fixes issue `#106 <https://github.com/danirus/django-comments-xtd/issues/106>`_, which is about computing the number of nested comments for every comment at every level down the tree. The fix consists of adding a new field called ``nested_count`` to the **XtdComment** model. Its value represents the number of threaded comments under itself. A new management command, ``initialize_nested_count``, can be used to update the value of the field, the command is idempotent. Two new migrations have been added: migration 0007 adds the new field, and migration 0008 calls the ``initialize_nested_count`` command to populate the ``nested_count`` new field with correct values.
    * Fixes issue `#215 <https://github.com/danirus/django-comments-xtd/issues/205>`_ about running the tests with Django 3.1 and Python 3.8.

[2.7.2] - 2020-09-08
--------------------

    * Fixes issue `#208 <https://github.com/danirus/django-comments-xtd/issues/208>`_, about the JavaScript plugin not displaying the like and dislike buttons and the reply link when django-comments-xtd is setup to allow posting comments only to registered users (``who_can_post: "users"``).
    * Fixes issue `#212 <https://github.com/danirus/django-comments-xtd/issues/212>`_, about missing i18n JavaScript catalog files for Dutch, German and Russian.

[2.7.1] - 2020-08-12
--------------------

    * Fixes issue `#188 <https://github.com/danirus/django-comments-xtd/issues/188>`_, about loading a templatetags module not required for the application.
    * Fixes issue `#196 <https://github.com/danirus/django-comments-xtd/issues/196>`_. When extending django-comments-xtd's comment model, the receiver function that reviews whether nested comments have to be publish or unpublish is not called.

[2.7.0] - 2020-08-09
--------------------

    * Enhancement, closing issue `#155 <https://github.com/danirus/django-comments-xtd/issues/155>`_ (and `#170 <https://github.com/danirus/django-comments-xtd/issues/170>`_), on how to post comments via the web API. Up until version 2.6.2 posting comments required the fields timestamp, security_hash and honeypot. As of 2.7.0 there is support allow Django REST Framework authentication classes: ``WriteCommentSerializer`` send the signal ``should_request_be_authorize`` that enables posting comments. Read the documentation about the web API.
    * Enhancement, closing issue `#175 <https://github.com/danirus/django-comments-xtd/issues/175>`_ on how to customize django-comments-xtd so that user images displayed in comments come from other sources. A new setting ``COMMENTS_XTD_API_GET_USER_AVATAR`` has been added. The docs have been extended with a page that explains the use case in depth.
    * Fixes issue `#171 <https://github.com/danirus/django-comments-xtd/issues/171>`_, on wrong permission used to decide whether a user is a moderator. The right permission is ``django_comments.can_moderate``. (thanks to Ashwani Gupta, @ashwani99).
    * Fixes issue `#136 <https://github.com/danirus/django-comments-xtd/issues/136>`_ on missing <link> element in the ``templates/base.html`` file distributed with the **tutorial.tar.gz** bundle.

[2.6.2] - 2020-07-05
--------------------

    * Adds Dutch translation (thanks to Jean-Paul Ladage, @jladage).
    * Adds Russian translation (thanks to Михаил Рыбкин, @MikerStudio).

    * Fixesissue `#149 <https://github.com/danirus/django-comments-xtd/issues/149>`_, on wrong SQL boolean literal value used when running special command ``populate_xtdcomments`` to load Postgres database with xtdcomments.
    * Fixes issue `#154 <https://github.com/danirus/django-comments-xtd/issues/154>`_, on using string formatting compatible with Python versions prior to 3.6.
    * Fixes issue `#156 <https://github.com/danirus/django-comments-xtd/issues/156>`_, on wrong props name ``poll_interval``. JavaScript plugin expects the use of ``polling_interval`` while the ``api/frontend.py`` module referred to it as ``poll_interval``. (thanks to @ashwani99).
    * Fixes issue `#159 <https://github.com/danirus/django-comments-xtd/issues/159>`_, about using the same id for all the checkboxes in the comment list. When ticking one checkbox in a nested form the checkbox of the main form was ticked. Now each checkbox has a different id, suffixed with the content of the ``reply_to`` field.

[2.6.1] - 2020-05-13
--------------------

    * Fixes issue `#150 <https://github.com/danirus/django-comments-xtd/issues/150>`_, about wrong protocol in the URL when fetching avatar images from gravatar.

[2.6.0] - 2020-05-12
--------------------

    * Fixes issue `#145 <https://github.com/danirus/django-comments-xtd/issues/145>`_, on inadequate number of SQL queries used by API entry point **comments-xtd-api-list**, available in the URL ``/comments/api/<content-type>/<object-pk>/``. The issue also happened when rendering the comments using tags ``get_xtdcomment_tree`` and ``render_xtdcomment_tree``. It has been fixed in both cases too.
    * Updates the JSON schema of the output retrieved by the API entry point **comments-xtd-api-list**. Thus the version number change. The flags attribute of each retrieved is now a list of flags instead of a summary for each the flags: "I like it", "I dislike it", "suggest removal".

[2.5.1] - 2020-04-27
--------------------

    * Fixes issue `#138 <https://github.com/danirus/django-comments-xtd/issues/138>`_, on unpublishing a single comment with public nested comments. The fix consists of a new ``pre_save`` receiver that will either publish or unpublish nested comments when a comment changes its ``is_public`` attribute. (thanks to @hematinik).

[2.5.0] - 2020-04-22
--------------------

    * Fixes issue `#144 <https://github.com/danirus/django-comments-xtd/issues/144>`_ regarding the size of the JavaScript bundle. The new JavaScript plugin does not include React and ReactDOM. The two libraries have to be loaded with an external script.
