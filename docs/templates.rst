.. index::
   single: email_confirmation_request
   pair: template; email_confirmation_request

``email_confirmation_request``
------------------------------

As ``.html`` and ``.txt``, this template represents the confirmation message sent to the user when the **Send** button is clicked to post a comment. Both templates are sent in a multipart message, or only in text format if the :setting:`COMMENTS_XTD_SEND_HTML_EMAIL` setting is set to ``False``.

In the context of the template the following objects are expected:

* The ``site`` object (django-contrib-comments, and in turn django-comments-xtd, use the `Django Sites Framework <https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.11/ref/contrib/sites/>`_).
* The ``comment`` object.
* The ``confirmation_url`` the user has to click on to confirm the comment.


.. index::
   single: comment_tree
   pair: template; comment_tree

``comment_tree.html``
---------------------

This template is rendered by the :ref:`render-xtdcomment-tree` to represent the comments posted to an object.

In the context of the template the following objects are expected:

* A list of dictionaries called ``comments`` in which each element is a dictionary like:

.. code-block:: python

    {
        'comment': xtdcomment_object,
        'children': [ list_of_child_xtdcomment_dicts ]
    }

Optionally the following objects can be present in the template:

* A boolean ``allow_flagging`` to indicate whether the user will have the
  capacity to suggest comment removal.
* A boolean ``allow_feedback`` to indicate whether the user will have the
  capacity to like/dislike comments. When ``True`` the special template
  ``user_feedback.html`` will be rendered.


.. index::
   single: comment_tree
   pair: template; comment_tree

``user_feedback.html``
----------------------

This template is expected to be in the directory ``includes/django_comments_xtd/``, and it provides a way to customized the look of the like and dislike buttons as long as the list of users who clicked on them. It is included from ``comment_tree.html``. The template is rendered only when the :ref:`render-xtdcomment-tree` is used with the argument ``allow_feedback``.

In the context of the template is expected:

* The boolean variable ``show_feedback``, which will be set to ``True`` when
  passing the argument ``show_feedback`` to the :ref:`render-xtdcomment-tree`.
  If ``True`` the template will show the list of users who liked the comment
  and the list of those who disliked it.
* A comment ``item``.

Look at the section :ref:`show-the-list-of-users` to read on this particular topic.
